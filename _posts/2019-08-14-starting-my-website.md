Finally taking the plunge and starting this website to document some of the things going on in my life. I have some ideas like a map of the world with places I've traveled, or maybe some blogs about coding projects I'm working on, but it's mostly experimentation. It seems like a good side hobby, and one which keeps me accountable to continue working on it (which is easy to say when I'm currently sitting on a plane with limited distractions). 

Anyway, stay tuned.
